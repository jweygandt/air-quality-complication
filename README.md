# Air Quality Complication for Wear OS

Measure the Air Quality Index (AQI) near you, right on your Wear OS watchface as a complication. If you suffer from wildfires or air pollution, this complication can help you decide when to stay indoors or wear protection.

This gets its data from community air sensors near you, using PurpleAir.com. It's based on the latest 10-minute PM2.5 average from the sensor you select.

No accuracy is guaranteed: these numbers are gathered by PurpleAir.com from sensors in the community who have decided to make their data public.
