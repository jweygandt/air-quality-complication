# Air Quality Complication for Wear OS

This is a simple app that shows a complication on the watchface which tells you the current AQI
(Air Quality Index) for your location. It uses the Purple Air API to download PM2.5 sensor data from
sensors nearest to you.

Useful for smartwatch users who are affected by air quality in their region.
